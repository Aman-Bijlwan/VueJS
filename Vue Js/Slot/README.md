# 📘 Vue Slot Example Project
This project showcases the various types of slots available in Vue, such as basic slots, fallback slots, named slots, and default slots. Slots are a powerful feature in Vue that allow you to compose and structure your components flexibly.

## 🎯 What are Slots?
Slots are a way to pass content from a parent component to a child component. They serve as placeholders that can be filled with any content you want. When you define a slot in a child component, you can then `"inject"` content into that slot from the parent component.

OR

A slot is like a space in a component where you can put different things. It allow you to create reusable components that can accept different content while maintaining a consistent structure.

## Why Use Slots?
- **Content Distribution :** Slots allow you to distribute content across different sections of a component.
- **Flexible Component Composition :** They enable you to design components that can be reused with different content, reducing the need to hard-code the content within the child component.


## 🔍 Exploring the Different Slot Types
### 1. Basic Slot 🧩
A basic slot allows you to pass any content from the parent to the child component. The slot content is rendered inside the child component wherever the `<slot></slot>` tag is placed.

Example:

```js
<!-- BasicSlot.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Some Content</p>
    <slot></slot> <!-- The content passed from the parent will be rendered here -->
    <p>Some other Content</p>
  </div>
</template>
```
***<ins>If you pass content like this from the parent:</ins>***
```js
<!-- Parent Component -->
<BasicSlot>
  <p>Content 1</p> <!-- This will be injected into the slot -->
</BasicSlot>
```
The output will be:

```css
Some Content
Content 1
Some other Content
```

### 2. Fallback Slot 🔄
A fallback slot is useful when you want to display default content if no content is provided for the slot. If the parent component does not pass content to the slot, the fallback content will be displayed.

Example:

```js
<!-- FallbackSlot.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <slot>
      <p>This is Fallback Slot content.</p> <!-- This will be shown if no content is passed from the parent -->
    </slot>
  </div>
</template>
```
<ins>***From the parent, if no content is passed:***</ins>

```js
<!-- Parent Component -->
<FallbackSlot></FallbackSlot>
```
The output will be:

```css
This is Fallback Slot content.
```

### 3. Named Slot 🏷️
A named slot is a way to assign a specific name to a slot in a component. Unlike the default slot, which is unnamed and used when no explicit name is provided, named slots allow you to have multiple slots in a component and specify where the content should be inserted based on the slot's name.

Example:
```js
<!-- NamedSlot.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <slot name="First"> </slot> <!-- Content for the 'First' slot -->
    <slot name="Second"> </slot> <!-- Content for the 'Second' slot -->
  </div>
</template>
```

***<ins>If you pass content like this from the parent:</ins>***

There are two methods to define and use named slots in Vue:
1. **Using `v-slot` directive :** This is the standard way to define slots by specifying the slot name.
2. **Using the Shorthand `#`  :** A more concise syntax that does the same as v-slot.

```js
<!-- Parent Component -->
<NamedSlot>
  <template v-slot:First>
    <p>This content is assigned to <b>First Slot</b> in NamedSlot component</p>
  </template>

  <template #Second>
    <p>This content is assigned to <b>Second Slot</b> in NamedSlot component</p>
  </template>
</NamedSlot>
```
### 4. Default Slot 🔧
A default slot is used when you want to pass content without explicitly naming the slot. If no slot name is provided in the parent, the content will be placed in the default slot.

Example:
```js
<!-- DefaultSlot.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <slot> </slot> <!-- This slot will be used for any content not assigned to a named slot -->
  </div>
</template>
```
***<ins>If you pass content like this from the parent:</ins>***

```js
<!-- Parent Component -->
<DefaultSlot>
  <template #default>
    <p>This is <b>Default Slot's</b> Content.</p>
  </template>
</DefaultSlot>
```

## 🛠️ Use Cases of Slots
1. **Customizable UI Components:** Create components like card layouts or modals that can display varying content depending on the context.
2. **Reusable Forms:** Pass form elements like inputs, buttons, and descriptions to a generic form layout component.
3. **Composing Layouts:** Build flexible page layouts where headers, footers, and main content can be dynamically swapped out.

## 📑 Overview of Slots Used in This Project

1. **Basic Slot:** Demonstrates how to inject content into a slot from the parent component.
2. **Fallback Slot:** Shows how to use fallback content if no content is provided for a slot.
3. **Named Slot:** Uses multiple named slots to control the placement of content within a child component.
4. **Default Slot:** Demonstrates the use of a default slot for content not assigned to named slots.


## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **`<slot> Tag:`** Placeholder for content passed from the parent.

- **`Named Slots:`** Allows multiple slots with different names in one component.

- **`Fallback Content:`** Default content displayed when no content is provided for a slot.
